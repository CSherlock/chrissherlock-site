                    <p>
                        My name is Chris, and I'm a 27 year old Test Engineer currently based in Sheffield. I've worked in this area for a fair few years
                        now (as the Experience section will show!), and am still learning every day. Currently, I'm trying to get better at cloud development,
                        particularly the challenge that serverless presents to testing!
                    </p>
                    <h3>That's cool and all, but what else do you do?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Very good question, me writing this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a serial board game loser, but that doesn't stop me from trying! Chances are, if you want to play a game against me, you're going
                        to win. I also go rock climbing in and around Sheffield, my personal best being a 6c+ top roping, 6b trad, and V4 bouldering (for those
                        in the know). I also play some musical instruments, namely guitar (badly), bass (less badly) and used to play drums. I've been a part of a
                        few bands in my past, but currently I'm working on my own stuff as and when I can.

                        I'm also learning Japanese, after becoming very interested in the country and 2 amazing holidays out there, so はじめまして and こんにちは!

                            Working as a member of the Identity &amp; Trust hub for the Department for Work &amp; Pensions (DWP) in Sheffield to improve
                            digital journeys for those applying for benefits such as Universal Credit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This involved performing testing of all areas, from functional testing to performance, security and accessibility. It also
                            involved making sure automated testing was performed as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline, with sufficient coverage
                            as to provide confidence in the deployments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also strived to mentor other testers within the Sheffield hub, particularly around improvements to automated testing capability,
                            helping those working alongside the DevOps team to add InSpec testing to their Infrastructure as Code capability when asked.

                        <p>
                            I also worked as part of a community of Senior Test Engineers across all sites to define a set of principles and practices that
                            could be used to align BPDTS testers and ensure we were always working to deliver the best quality we could.

                            Moving into a new role, I took on responsibility along with one other teammate to the maintenance and improvement of the Core Tribe's
                            automated testing capability. This meant that I was now a cross-Tribe resource, working alongside all teams to ensure our coverage was

                            As part of this role, I also participated with cross-Tribe discussions on how to improve this across the business. Due to the size of the
                            company, there were lots of teams attempting similar things, so this tried to align us as best as possible.

                            My day-to-day work involved maintaining of Jenkins testing pipelines, improving our test automation coverage and providing toolkits that
                            could be leveraged by all teams for common functionality such as reporting, safely accessing secrets such as API keys from Hashicorp Vault, and

                            Moving back to Sheffield, I joined Sky Betting &amp; Gaming's Core Tribe as part of the Payments team, whose day-to-day tasks involved
                            developing the payments systems for the whole site, ensuring deposits and withdrawals continued to flow. I also assisted with any live incidents
                            that may have occurred in this area, ensuring that any issues were mitigated with as few customers affected as possible. This involved testing
                            across a wide range of browsers, devices, and through web and native applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my time on this team, we successfully delivered the Fast Withdrawals project, which saw customers for certain banks eligible to get their
                            withdrawals into their accounts in under 2 hours, compared to the regular 2 to 5 days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As part of this team, I maintained the regression test packs for Payments. This consisted of API tests and UI tests, written in Java and using
                            Selenium WebDriver for the front end testing. I also assisted with general upkeep of other test packs, which would lead me into my next role.
